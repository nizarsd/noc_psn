/*

The average energy dissipated by a flit for a hop switch was estimated
as being 0.151nJ, 0.178nJ, 0.182nJ and 0.189nJ for XY, Odd-Even, DyAD,
and NoP-OE respectively

We assumed the tile size to be 2mm x 2mm and that the tiles were
arranged in a regular fashion on the floorplan. The load wire
capacitance was set to 0.50fF per micron, so considering an average of
25% (25% of lines change state) switching activity the amount of energy consumed by a flit for a
hop interconnect is 0.384nJ.
